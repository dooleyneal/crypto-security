Consider the alpha-numeric position of each letter (a=1, b=2, ...).
This cipher returns the letter 13 spaces following it, with z looping back to a.

Here is the alphabet run through this cipher:
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f g h i j k l m 

The phrase "I love cryptography" passed through the cipher yields:
"v ybir pelcgbtemcul"

Since the order of our cipher is 2, the inverse of this cipher is the cipher itself.
